# Pitch

What is preventing me from leaving Ki editor for other modal editors such as Neovim, Kakoune or Helix?

## 1. First-class syntax/structural navigation and modification

Moving across syntax nodes, selecting syntax nodes, deleting them, copying and pasting them, swapping.

These are not after thoughts.

## 2. Built-in global search and replace

## 3. Same keybindings at every components
