# Why Ki?

## 1. First-class structural selection

To select the largest AST node under the cursor, simply press `s` (Syntax Node). 

This feature is handy if you ever asked this question: _"How can I select the current expression/function/argument/statement?"_

And this works as long as your language is blessed by the Tree-sitter grammarians.
